# Discrete-Math-Algos

This is a collection of a few algorithms that
I implemented for a Discrete Math course.

The first is an implementation of the Euclidean 
Algorithm. The user enters 2 numbers and the GCD 
is calculated. 

The second Algorithm is the creation of a lattice 
of n by n size, where n is the size inputted by 
the user. It outputs the number of paths available.

The third algorithm checks a sequence to determine 
if the roots are distinct, repeated, or imaginary.
